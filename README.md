# Sorting-Visualizer
Created a web application using HTML, CSS, Javascript to visualize how various sorting algorithms work.


We all have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.


That's why I've made this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work and through this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.
This project is a good start for beginners who have dabbled in data structures and algorithms using Javascript before and also web developers. The methodology can be applied to showcase any algorithm of one's choosing !
